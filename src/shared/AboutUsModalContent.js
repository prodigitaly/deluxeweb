      <div className=" text-xl	 font-bold">OUR OPERATION</div>
      <p>
        All the cleaning operations are executed in a central plant. Dirty and
        clean garments are transferred via an efficient fleet network between
        the central plant and the retail outlets. The company works extensively
        to ensure that its services are available to the customer in all
        convenient locations. SparkleUp uses fully automatic state of the
        art washing and dry cleaning systems with automatic dosing units. Our
        brand is known for its use of mild chemicals and best spotting agents in
        the industry for best treatment of fragile and expensive fibers.

      <div className=" text-xl	 font-bold">OUR PROCESS</div>
      <p>
        We sort your laundry by color before washing; dark with darks, light
        with lights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use a delicate wash; washing darks in cold water and whites in
        hot/warm water to brighten the fabric and clean stains better.
      </p>
      <p>
        We dry all clothes in low/medium heat. Your clean laundry is then
        professionally folded.
